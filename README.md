# DCSC-homework 1:  A "pipeline" and a Dockerfile


1. Create a Python script that:

accepts 2 command line arguments, 
reads a csv from the first argument
does something to the data
saves the results to the csv defined by the second argument
2. Create a Dockerfile that:

pulls from Python Docker image
copies the script above into the container
runs the script above when the container starts
NOTE: you can use files created during the demo.

3. Check both into a repo on Github and open a pull request

4. Submit the link to the pull request on Canvas
